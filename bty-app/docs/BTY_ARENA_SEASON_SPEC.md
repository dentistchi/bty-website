==============================
BTY ARENA — SEASON SYSTEM SPEC
==============================

This defines the official season structure of BTY Arena.

----------------------------------
SEASON MODEL
----------------------------------

We use a PERSONAL SEASON model with GLOBAL LEADERBOARD.

This means:

1) Each user progresses through Season 1, Season 2, Season 3 individually.
2) Weekly XP leaderboard is time-bound (30-day cycle).
3) Core XP never resets.
4) Competition is global per time window.
5) Progression difficulty increases per season.

----------------------------------
SEASON LENGTH
----------------------------------

MVP: 30 days per season

Future full system: 90 days optional
(but MVP remains 30-day cycle)

----------------------------------
SEASON 1 — FOUNDATION
----------------------------------

Target: Orientation + Baseline Leadership Awareness

Characteristics:
- Lower difficulty simulations
- Faster early XP gain
- Core leadership fundamentals
- Gratitude & Integrity foundation emphasis

Goal:
Build rhythm and habit.

----------------------------------
SEASON 2 — EXPANSION
----------------------------------

Target: Operational Leadership & Conflict Mastery

Characteristics:
- Medium difficulty simulations
- More decision branching
- Higher XP reward per task
- Real-world operational scenarios

Goal:
Strengthen leadership under pressure.

----------------------------------
SEASON 3 — STRATEGIC MODE
----------------------------------

Target: Executive-Level Decision Architecture

Characteristics:
- High complexity simulations
- Multi-layer impact decisions
- CEO-level scenario logic

Goal:
Train long-horizon thinking and organizational design mindset.

----------------------------------
SEASON PROGRESSION RULES
----------------------------------

- Users begin at Season 1.
- Completion criteria: XP threshold or task completion requirement.
- Users move to next season individually.
- Seasons do NOT reset Core XP.
- Weekly XP resets per time window (30 days).

----------------------------------
LEADERBOARD RULE
----------------------------------

Leaderboard is based on WEEKLY XP only.

At end of 30-day window:
- Top 5% → Elite announcement
- Weekly XP resets
- Core XP continues accumulating

----------------------------------
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION
----------------------------------

Season progression ≠ Leaderboard ranking.

Season = personal difficulty progression.
Leaderboard = competitive time-based ranking.

----------------------------------
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
----------------------------------

1. Early seasons = confidence building.
2. Later seasons = cognitive load expansion.
3. Competition is motivating.
4. Growth is cumulative.
5. Pride comes from sustained discipline.
