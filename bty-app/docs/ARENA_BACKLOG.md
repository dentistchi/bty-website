## UI Bugs (to fix in Phase 3: Dashboard/UI)
- Mentor page header UI overlaps:
  - "English" checkbox appears next to training area
  - EN/KO toggle overlaps with Logout button (top-right)
  - Repro: /en/bty/mentor (after logout or in logged-in header)
  - Expected: header actions should not overlap; consistent language selector UX
